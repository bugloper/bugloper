      <title>Does An Idea Speak For Itself?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Language is far more deeply rooted in reality than we often realize. Without language, how do we really do anything?  I believe that without language, there is no e = mc²—at least not in the ultimate sense that language gives birth to the laws of physics. But without language, how do we understand, grasp, or know it in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Language is a tool of communication. Often, highly intelligent individuals with strong technical skills feel underappreciated. Those working in corporate or bureaucratic environments frequently blame their circumstances. While this is certainly a variable, I believe the roots of this experience go back to the earliest forms of human communication. It&amp;rsquo;s fundamental to biology. Our brains are designed so that their chemical signals can be understood or made sense of through language. In this way, language is an evolutionary aspect of humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have one life, and in this life, I want to do everything. My mind is incredibly voracious—it yearns for everything the universe has to offer: science, philosophy, mathematics, poetry, socializing, music, sleep, quietness, emotions, infinity. That’s why I hate the phrase “jack of all trades, master of none.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One life—that’s it. That’s why you should try to do all the things you love.&#xA;But when it comes to curiosity, if you want to achieve something great in one domain, you need deep focus. The cost of this all-encompassing curiosity is that it often hinders doing what’s essential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
