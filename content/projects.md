Here are some of my projects and work.

### [esrever](https://github.com/bugloper/esrever)
A lightweight reverse proxy written in Go, inspired by nginx, designed to efficiently route and forward HTTP traffic. Built as a hobby project for learning and experimentation.

### [homebrew-seli](https://github.com/bugloper/homebrew-seli)
