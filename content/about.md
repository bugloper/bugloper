## Who I Am

I'm a software engineer passionate about building meaningful tools and exploring the deeper questions that technology raises. I believe in the power of clear communication, both in code and in writing, and I'm constantly seeking to understand not just *how* things work, but *why* they matter.

## What I Do

I build software, write code, and occasionally share my thoughts through writing. My work spans various domains—from creating Ruby gems that solve real problems to exploring reverse engineering and system design. I'm particularly interested in:

- **Engineering**: Building robust, maintainable software systems
- **Writing**: Exploring ideas through words and code
- **Learning**: Understanding the fundamentals behind the tools we use
- **Teaching**: Sharing knowledge through clear explanations and examples

## Philosophy

I believe that true understanding goes beyond memorizing formulas or following tutorials. It requires grasping the underlying principles, asking the right questions, and connecting ideas across different domains. This is why I write—to explore these connections and share what I learn along the way.
