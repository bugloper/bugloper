+++
I have one life, and in this life, I want to do everything. My mind is incredibly voracious—it yearns for everything the universe has to offer: science, philosophy, mathematics, poetry, socializing, music, sleep, quietness, emotions, infinity. That’s why I hate the phrase “jack of all trades, master of none.” 

One life—that’s it. That’s why you should try to do all the things you love.
But when it comes to curiosity, if you want to achieve something great in one domain, you need deep focus. The cost of this all-encompassing curiosity is that it often hinders doing what’s essential. 

I call this The Curse of Curiosity.
